Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a basic implementation of the popular game of Tic-Tac-Toe. It has been developed using Python and the Tkinter GUI toolkit.

Setup
To run the game, you will need to have Python 3.x and the Tkinter module installed on your system. Once you have these installed, simply download the tictactoe.py file and run it from the command line or from within an IDE of your choice.

Game Rules
The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Each player takes turns to place their symbol (X or O) on the grid. The first player to get 3 symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all the spaces on the board are filled and no player has won, the game is declared a tie.

Game Features
Players can choose to start as either X or O.
The game keeps track of scores for each player and ties.
Players can choose to play again after the game is over.
Code Structure
The code is structured into several functions that handle different aspects of the game:

Initialization Functions: These functions handle the initialization of the game board and various game variables.
Drawing Functions: These functions handle the drawing of the game board and various game elements (X's and O's, game over messages, etc.) on the canvas.
Logical Functions: These functions handle the logical aspects of the game (checking for wins, checking if a grid space is occupied, etc.).
Mainloop Function: This function handles the main game loop and listens for user input (clicks on the canvas).
Acknowledgements
This game has been developed as a basic learning exercise using Python and Tkinter. It has been inspired by various Tic-Tac-Toe game implementations available online.
